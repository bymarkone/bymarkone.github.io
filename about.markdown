![That is me](/assets/me.png){:style="width: 250px; margin-right: 20px; float: left;"}

I am a developer. These days I've been working as a Tech Principal at ThoughtWorks, where I still get the opportunity to code sometimes, but mostly I am talking about tech strategy and how to execute it. I have a lot of stories to tell about legacy evolution, microservices implementation, evolutionary architecture, software engineering culture and agility, products, devops, and the role of technology in digital transformation. 

During the past twenty years I've wrote code and/or advised on the following domains: Healthcare, Government, Supply Chain, Logistics, Automotive, Airlines, Financial, Banking, and EDI. I've worked for big and small companies in Latin and North America, and Europe. I am/was part of the adivsors board of a couple of these companies.

I have a keen interest in Math, I spent a lot of my free time reading Cambridge books and studying for my second Bachelors, in Pure Mathematics. Around Math I love Finance, Economics, Physics and Chemistry (also Neuroscience and Biochemestry, but these are not close to math). I try to complete as many programs as I can from eDX (specially MIT ones) on these topics. 

I do research on AI and the role of language to advance the AI field. 

I am also the author of tLan, a terminal application with a DSL that helps busy, purposeful people to manage their time.
