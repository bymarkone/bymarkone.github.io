Hi, this is Marcos. Times like these are times to read. I will share below a list of publications about the economy, business, health, and science that I've been trying to follow up with on a regular basis. Also, I summarize learnings in doing a Economics course at MIT.

**What to read during the crisis**. There is huge uncertainty of how the world will emerge out of this crisis. Here is a list of online publications I've been following in order to make better decisions for my life and companies I am influencing. [McKinsey's](https://www.mckinsey.com/) website is a rich source of variate domain, strategy, and management insights. To catch up with the daily number of cases and different statistical trends I look mainly into [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus), and use some specific governmentsâ€™ data to crosscheck (e.g. [Germany](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html), [Spain](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/situacionActual.htm), [U.S.](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map)). [HBR](https://hbr.org/insight-center/coronavirus), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/), [MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/) are always publishing interesting stuff, and in the last few months, many are crisis-related. I also try to keep up with news and articles on sites such as the [WorldBank](https://www.worldbank.org/), [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/), [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/), [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/index.htm), and [World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/). All of these websites and magazines have a newsletter subscription service. The way I do is that I am subscribed to all of them and when I get emails I filter the things I want to take a deeper look into my inbox and slowly digest them.

**MIT Sloan Economics for Business:** After having finished the course (you can find a more detailed report [here](https://bymarkone.github.io/article/2020/04/12/economics-for-business-learnings.html)), there are three key learnings:

1. Macroeconomic policies will always disfavor some groups in the economic ecosystem. The first question posed for class reflection was "Are you a bad person?" I am quite sure everybody answered no, just to see after the next activity that our suggestions on how to fix the economy were full of prejudice and harmed some economic groups. 
2. The role of education in the context of speed and innovation. At some point, we were discussing the current Digital revolution, with special lenses in AI, and considering the impact on the labor market and the need for a large scale education system for teaching adults to have new professions and capabilities.
3. The path to keeping social and economic equilibrium goes through increasing productivity through the use of technology. Countries and companies need to make use of technology to bring up the standard of living for everybody in a society.
