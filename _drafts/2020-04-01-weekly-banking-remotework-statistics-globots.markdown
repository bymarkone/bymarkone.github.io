Hi, this is Marcos. Mentally I feel the dust of the corona crisis is slowly settling, allowing me to read and share more as I try to understand the world that it is about to come. In this edition some reflections about consumer banking, the use and misuse of statistics, points of view on remote work, and globots.

**Consumer banking through the pandemic**. I was reading [this](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/Leading-a-consumer-bank-through-the-coronavirus-pandemic?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck&hlkid=1278a8c47d594a818b2b96ebb378d8fd&hctky=11294614&hdpid=7a297bd5-da41-43a7-9a82-0244f6a280ae) article from McKinsey about the topic. McKinsey believes the pandemic will increase the adoption of banking digital technologies. The estimated numbers for China and Italy markets are 10 to 20%. Three key challenges during the crisis the industry must pay attention: (1) How to implement a flexible operation model, including health measures for employees and consumers, limiting access to human contact, promoting and organizing for remote work, and taking measures to maintain employee morale; (2) How to serve clients in challenging times, including showing true care for clients, and supporting new ways of work; (3) How to accelerate out of the downturn, especially when we begin to understand the real economic cost of the crisis, including increasing the use of digital abilities to boost customer engagement, improving financial advice and encouraging relationship-based banking.

**Use and misuse of statistics**. [Here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) is a study conducted by researches in the UK about the caracter√≠sticis of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the study behind the hard decision of many countries in applying strict isolation measures. In a time of good and bad statistics circulating all over the place, it is always good to a basis against which judging all others.

**Companies share their point of views on remote working**. I've seen three: [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/remote-work-playbook?utm_campaign=remoteplaybook&utm_medium=social&utm_source=LinkedIn), [MIT Horizon](https://open.mit.edu/c/workofthefuture/1lh/mit-horizons-guide-to-working-from-home), and [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-remote-working-lessons-from-china?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck&hlkid=71a1ebea808e42f9a82e0716ac7ffae8&hctky=11294614&hdpid=8a7d725d-49e2-4b4e-91f7-ff6a4dadb4b5).

**Globots are coming**. I've recently watched the video [The Globotics Upheaval: Globalization, Robotics, and the Future of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-A11h4qVlY), which caused me to have one of those "ah-ha" moments: The type of automation what we are seeing happening now in the world is different in nature, speed, and scope compared to the automation we've been seeing in the last decades. In nature, because the automation that we are seeing now is not the automation in industry, but in the third sector. In speed, because this is coming with unprecedented ideas. And in scope, because this is global.
