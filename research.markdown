I am researching the role of language in advancing the AI field.

More specifically I am considering the role of language in the formation of the human mind. My hope is that by understanding that connection, I may be able to develop AI techniques that will advance over the current ones based on statistics and linear algebra. 

Right now I am going throught the following books:

- Chomsky. Language and Mind.
- Chomsky. On Language.
- George Yule. The Study of Language.
- Steven Pinker. The Language Instinct 
- Steven Pinker. The Stuff of Thought.

My goal is to soon (beginning of 2021) kick-off a more academic literature review on the topic.
