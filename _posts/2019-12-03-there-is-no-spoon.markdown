Have you ever felt that your whole life is nothing but a dream? How could you tell the difference if dreams seem so real?

Questioning our own reality is something not many of us dare to do. I know a few people who question their situations in one way or another. They question their opinions, their knowledge level, their comfort zone. But I haven’t seen many people who question the air they breathe and the natural rules that supposedly govern the world.

Descartes, considered by some the father of modern science, did exactly that. He decided he would question the whole of observed reality and start building truth from the basis of cogito ergo sum.

In this article and the following ones, we will use The Matrix series as a gateway into philosophical ideas that are full of meaning in our present age and, in this author’s opinion, full of practical implications in our daily lives.

In Matrix, Neo — just like us many times in life — needs to deconstruct his entire reality and then reconstruct it again.

### The look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.

Only before the reconstruction, he needs to question. He needs to recognize that something is not the way it should be. This is how the movie begins, with the feeling that there is something wrong. In the first conversation with Neo, Morpheus says: “You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up” (Morpheus, 26:42). There is something strange about how he perceives reality. And it is only after doubt and suspicion towards a certain object take over the subject that the definitive step — that irrevocable decision to open the eyes and investigate the truth — can be taken. It is not a surprise that Socrates once said: “wonder is the beginning of wisdom.”

Moved by wonder, Neo is about to make a decision that will fully reset his worldview. Cypher gives him a piece of advice on it: “Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy, because Kansas is going bye-bye!” (Cypher, 30:42)

This feeling of mistrust is awfully uncomfortable. We don’t accept ignorance. We don’t relish the idea of not being in control, as if the situation around us depended on factors that are external to us. It feels like we fight so hard to reach a certain level of understanding either of the worlds around us or of how we think things actually work in real life that doubting becomes our biggest fear. In such cases, what shall we do when we start realizing there might be a better alternative? We can create many illusions to make ourselves happy in our comfort zone, giving ourselves the feeling that there is actually nothing to worry with. Laziness and diversions will always be there, each playing their role in trying to make us more distracted.

It is metaphoric that later in the movie Cypher will opt for the illusion. “I know this steak doesn’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? Ignorance is a bliss.” (Cypher, 1:03:30)

Neo, however, opts for the painful path. “I didn’t say it would be easy, I just said it was going to be the truth.” (Morpheus, 43:50)

### Do you believe that it is air you are breathing?

After getting himself back together, Neo wakes up from a dream in which he lived in the XX century, in the heyday of the human civilization, to a reality some hundred years later, as the few remaining free humans are runaways being persecuted in every corner of the planet. The great majority is carefully preserved, imprisoned in order to provide energy to a dominant civilization of machines.

The Matrix is a computer system that connects all these human beings, transformed into batteries, in order to give them a social context and keep their brains alive while the machines suck their energy dry. It is a virtual simulation providing everything humans need in order to keep on living — a social and professional life, aspirations, great and small pleasures, and some illusion of autonomy — while they ignore the fact that they actually live and die in a capsule, and that their lives are nothing but disposable batteries.

Neo gradually gets to try out the possibilities that the cold and insipid world outside the Matrix offers. If the Matrix is a virtual reality, would there be a problem in redefining some of its rules? “What is real? How do you define real? If you mean the things you can feel, smell, taste and see, then real is merely a set of electrical impulses interpreted by your brain…” (Morpheus, 40:36). The matrix is a world of rules: “Rules like gravity. What you must learn is that these rules are no different from the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken.” (Morpheus, 48:30). During their first fight, Morpheus asks “How did I beat you? Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles? Do you believe it’s air you’re breathing now?” Rules start to be broken, paradigms start being shifted, or rewritten.

The talk with the spoon boy in the Oracle’s waiting room brings some interesting points which will eventually help Neo understand reality: “Do not try to bend the spoon. That’s impossible. Instead … only try to realize the truth” says the boy. The truth that “There is no spoon. Then you’ll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.” (Boy, 1:11:38).

Is it really possible that a change with extraordinarily practical implications could be as simple as changing what you believe?

### Know thyself

Neo finally gets to meet the Oracle. On the one hand, he is confronted with a sign reading Temet Nosce, stamped on a plate on the door. Getting to know yourself is something that is not easy or quick to anyone. Neo will have to deconstruct a reality which is more painful than the first one (second film) if he wants to achieve the goal intended in his story. On the other hand, “don’t worry about the vase” (Oracle, 1:13:11) when Neo had not yet broken it can make anyone intrigued. “Would you still have broken it if I hadn’t said anything?” (Oracle, 1:13:30). How can the cause of an event be the anticipation of its consequence?

That is too much trouble for you to find out you are not the Chosen One.

This is an interesting trick the Oracle plays here. Later in the movie, we will find out that the Oracle is a software program too. And she is responsible for the application that enabled the Matrix to survive, an application that is the illusion of free will. When the first version of the Matrix was created, the system did not allow humans to make any kind of decisions (nor gave them the illusion that they did), and the result of that was that humans would die and machines would see a monumental failure in their energy crops. When the illusion of choice was designed and introduced as a feature of the Matrix, humans beings did not reject the source code anymore and it became possible to keep the bodies alive, thus generating the necessary energy. Humans need to believe they are in control of things in order to survive.

Saying to Neo that he is not the Chosen One, so that he eventually “decides” to be, is exactly the illusion the Oracle needs to create in order to gain control of the situation and make sure that he accomplishes the plan — after all, the chosen one must reach the Source (second film). “Oh, don’t worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door, you’ll start feeling better. You’ll remember you don’t believe in any of this fate crap. You’re in control of your own life, remember?” (Oracle, 1:15:54).

### He believes in this so blindly

Morpheus: The famous, powerful and mysterious Morpheus. He is, in the first movie — and much more in the second and third ones — the classical example of blind faith: “Morpheus believes in you, Neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he’s going to sacrifice his life to save yours. You’re going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you’ll have Morpheus’ life and on the other hand, you’ll have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you.” (Oracle, 1:16:05). Morpheus needs no hope, he knows it. He has his time for glory at the end of the movie — it seems he eventually found the Chosen One, as the Oracle had told him he would. The dimensions of the illusions he so blindly believed will only be made clear to us, as well as to him, at the end of the second movie.

Cypher’s betrayal and, most importantly, Morpheus’ decision for self-sacrifice inspire Neo to take some action. This time he is going to enter the highly secure fortress, filled with agents, in order to rescue his rescuer. This is something new, “nobody has ever done this before” (Trinity, 1:39:05). However, this adventure is only the tip of the iceberg compared to what we are about to see. Maybe it is a sign of bravery, or a shade of the decision that will get the Chosen One ready for more elevated ones, like a warm-up. “The Oracle told you exactly what you need to hear. Neo, sooner or later you are going to realize just as I did that there’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.” (Morpheus, 1:52:00)

For Neo, the second step towards the top is to make the decision of not running from Smith in the train station but to fight him. Too much for only one day. He began without knowing who he was and what role he was supposed to play in this world, then broke into a fortress, got shot indiscriminately, saved Morpheus, and had an argument with an agent. There is a lot yet to come, but he did not get there unscathed.

### The kiss

The end of the film is packed with emotions. Trinity and Morpheus are on the Nebuchadnezzar hovercraft waiting for Neo to make the phone call that will bring him back. But the sentinel robots find the hovercraft and break the hull in order to kill everyone. Morpheus, in his faith, knows that Neo is the Chosen One, and that he will make it. He will only activate the EMP (to destroy the all machines around them including the sentinels and the ship) after he gets back to the hovercraft. Trinity stands next to Morpheus, but for different reasons. Reasons that are key to understanding the series.

When Neo dies for the first time, time stands still. Morpheus does not understand what is happening: “Can’t be!” (Morpheus, 2:03:04), as if his whole world had crumbled. It is Trinity who has a chance to speak now, with an unwavering hope that he is not dead: “Neo, I’m not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love and that that man… the man that I loved would be The One. So you see, you can’t be dead. You can’t be… because I love you. You hear me? I love you” (2:04:04). And then she kisses him.

Neo wakes up from death. And with him, a new worldview. So brand new that he is no longer an ordinary man doing extraordinary things with the existing rules. He now removes and creates the rules. He does not need to turn away from bullets. He manipulates the elements that construct the reality of the Matrix. He sees things the way they actually are.

### Who cares?

Today I am a software developer working for a global company, actively engaged in the software community and who studies hard … Why should I be so interested in the things that happen in this science fiction movie filled with fights and philosophy? Aren’t my profession, hobbies, and family enough to consume my time? Why should I take those things more seriously than I take the existence of Santa Klaus?

Unfortunately, this is how many of us address the so-called “philosophical” issues, which are actually inherently human and have practical consequences in all spheres of life. Sometimes it goes even further than that: whether we notice or not, our personality, actions, and beliefs are defined by our worldview. And we are wrought into that mold without even knowing — having few if not zero freedom of choice on it — at least until we start deliberately trying to comprehend who we actually are. Sometimes this is so rooted in our way of thinking we can’t even differ what is a social or psychological construction from what is really the truth.

“I am a practical person, I don’t like theory,” “People are measured by the value they add,” “I don’t care about truth or definitions, I just want to experience,” “I don’t care about emotions or feelings, I am a rational person,””The most important thing is feeling happy,” “There is no truth, everything is relative,” “If they are poor it is their problem, not mine,” “We are all accountable for one another.” Where do all these and other ideas come from, and how can I know they are really genuinely mine instead of suggestions that I naively accepted, submissive and obedient? I want to be free to choose.

### Not really

The film ends with a short speech as Neo flies. The scene is successful in showing the new horizons that can be achieved. And to stress how big this lie is.

“I know you’re out there. I can feel you now. I know that you’re afraid… you’re afraid of us. You’re afraid of change. I don’t know the future. I didn’t come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it’s going to begin. I’m going to hang up this phone, and then I’m going to show these people what you don’t want them to see. I’m going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.”

No rules or control?

Freedom of choice?

Not really.
