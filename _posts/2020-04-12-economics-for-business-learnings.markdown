Recently I finished the MIT Sloan online course Economics for Business. It was a great experience, not only because the classes are great, but because of the opportunities to share ideas with executives in other countries and industries. Everyone had the opportunity to share analysis of countries and situations of choice, and contribute to others' analysis, draw lessons and applications to real cases.

In terms of content, here are the most important things:
<!--more-->

1. We started by using the idea of the Babysitter Economy to model our understanding of macroeconomics. We learned about offer and demand, trading, money, banks, economic crisis, the role of governments and the effectiveness of policies. The Babysitter Economy is an analogy created by Paul Krugman where a group of people with small kids decide to print some coupons and distribute within the group, and subsequently exchanging coupons for time baby-sitting the others' kids. The "economy" is working well until a new couple arrived in the group and decided to not give their kids for others, ending up accumulating a lot of coupons. The reflection on what to do in such circumstances rendered a lot of discussions especially due to the great number of comparisons with real scenarios. 
2. Then we studied moments of crisis and the effect of consumer confidence in economics. We draw several scenarios and tried different approaches to reacting to a crisis. It is unfortunate and at the same time very interesting to look at the world of COVID-19 with the mind still fresh of studying the economic impact of a crisis. There was one special chapter on banks and why they are especially fragile in moments of crisis (we dived into the idea of *maturity transformation*, and studied the importance of regulations to balance the fragility of the banking system). In between classes, the professor posted some videos with interviews, one particularly interesting was with [Athanasios Orphanides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasios_Orphanides), former Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and economic advisor in the U.S.
3. The next topic was the BBNN model, which expands the economic view to include external markets and trade. The BBNN model takes into consideration two variables, internal demand, and internal market competitiveness. These two variables, and their respective model in a chart, help us derive two important measurements for any country, the current account and the labor market situation (overheated or unemployment).
   1.  We spent a lot of time in the website [trading economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/) looking at official data from many countries in America, Asia, and Europe. The main data we observed was the *current account to GDP*, *GDP growth*, *wages*, and *inflation rate*. The goal was to look at a specific country at some key time (crisis in 2009, economic booms, nowadays) and look at how our impressions about that country match the data.
   2. The BBNN points to a point of equilibrium where both the internal demand and the labor market are optimized for a country-specific context. We classified many countries using the data from trading economics and analyzed how far those countries are from the equilibrium, as well as discussed ideas on how to address the economic situation of that country.
   3. We've also analyzed something called the development ladder. The development latter helps understand how shifts in productivity change the position of the equilibrium in the BBNN.
4. Before we finish the course we looked into something called the Latin Triangle. The Latin Triangle adds yet another "line" (the social piece) to the BBNN model which captures the level of satisfaction of people in a country with the economy. It is a triangle because of the intersection of the three lines (the current account equilibrium, the labor market equilibrium, and the social peace line). It is called Latin because the movements across the vertices of the triangle resemble a typical political cycle in Latin American countries: economic equilibrium (first vertex) is usually followed by social unrest, which leads to measures to increase social peace, usually for part of the population, while the other part goes into high levels of unemployment (second vertex). Then comes a moment of focusing on the ever-increasing population suffering the downsides of the economic boom. This is usually the moment when politicians appeal to populist approaches, attempting to improve the situation of workers at the cost of deficit in the current account and borrowing. We reflected on how the model reflects the situation of the U.S. today, despite its less developed original focus.
5. The last week was about the concept and measurement of value. There is something really wrong if our list of most important and valuable things doesn't match with the list of activities that we spent most of our time. Also, in an economy, if we value something and don't measure it, or if we measure and don't optimize it, something is broken.

The three top lessons of the course were:

1. Macroeconomic policies will always disfavor some groups in the economic ecosystem. The first question posed for class reflection was "Are you a bad person?" I am quite sure everybody answered no, just to see after the next activity that our suggestion of how to fix the economy was full of prejudice and harmed other groups. 
2. The role of education in the context of speed and innovation. At some point, we were discussing the current Digital revolution, with special lenses in AI, and considering the impact on the labor market and the need of a large scale education platform for teach adults to have new professions and capabilities.
3. The path to keeping social and economic equilibrium goes through increasing productivity through the use of technology. Countries and companies need to make use of technology to bring a better standard of living to everybody in a society.
